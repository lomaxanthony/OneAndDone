# One&Done Golf

**One&Done Golf** is a web application designed to track player standings and earnings in a golf league. Players select one golfer per tournament, and the earnings from that golfer are added to their season total. Players cannot select the same golfer more than once per season. The player with the highest earnings at the end of the season wins the contest. The app features a dynamic leaderboard that displays player rankings based on total earnings, along with additional stats about a player's selections and golfer performance.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Leaderboard**: Displays player rankings and total earnings, updated in real time.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile viewing.
- **Backend Integration**: Retrieves player data and earnings from a database for accurate standings.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Leaderboard automatically sorted by earnings, with potential for additional filters and sorting options.

This project is currently in development, with a focus on building and testing the frontend layout to streamline integration with backend APIs and database functionality.
